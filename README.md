      - Colour Scheme, As a site owner I would like my site to be bright and engaging.
 ### Database View
 I had Created created various options of how I could create the database and models within, In the end I took the decision to utilise allauth connected to a custom
 user model, this allowed me to create users in a singular model allowing for easier querys to the database. Below is the database scheme along side the dataflow for
 application.

 ### Design
     - When Creating this application I found that an abundance of pre-built templates fit the mold of what I was trying to achieve, I eventually settled on a 
        template that fit the asthetic that I was trying to achieve, although I customised the contents of the template the basic structure is from a template.

 ### Images
     - I felt that although the theme throughout the site is quite bright and colourful that I should use images that would bring back to the angle the 
     site is coming from, with gardening and horticulte being prominent. Images sourced from ![Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)
